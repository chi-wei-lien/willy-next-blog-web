"Telling stories about your life lets people know they’re not alone" — Matthew Dicks

I still remember the first thing I tell people when I just arrived in the US is that English is my second language, and I can't speak properly. People usually first give me a weird look and tell me that my English is fine. I was nervous. Nervous about being laughed at, nervous about not getting jokes from others, nervous about staying in the US without having any friends for 4 years. But hey! March tenth, I ran a workshop with 30 participants who doesn't care about my English at all and just trying to learn how to create a personal website. That felt great. Great because, one, they are all nice people, and I can tell from their question, they really want to learn this topic. Two, I realized that people don't judge you because you can't speak good English.

I remember, in the past, no matter if it is a small presentation in class, a video I want to post on Youtube, I almost always write a script and memorize the whole thing. Oftentimes people think I can speak English fluently because of this. However, I'm really just reading in a script in my mind with a very casual tone. After staying in the US for one and a half-semester, I feel like I can finally express my thoughts without having to think about everything once before I open my mouth. It's a pretty cool feeling honestly. Sometimes you think in Chinese, sometimes you think in English, and sometimes you just don't think at all because your brain can't pick one. I guess the whole purpose of this blog is to tell people who are also struggling to speak another language that you are not alone. Just like the beautiful quote I used to start this journal. It just takes time. However, that doesn't mean that there is no technique to improve faster. Here are some tricks I used to trick my brain to become better at speaking English.

Talk To Yourself Like a Psychopath
I somehow find this funny, but it is super effective. In the past few years, whenever I was taking a shower, I start imagining a situation where I have to talk and just start talking to myself. Usually, I talked very quietly to not make my parents think I'm crazy. The coolest part of this technique is that sometimes those situations do take place. For example, once when I was taking a shower, I imagined talking on stage on the last day of school when everyone is very emotional. Although, in the end, we all met on zoom because of COVID and I decided to speak Chinese instead, the content is mostly similar.

Memorizing Isn't a Terrible Idea
Remember that I mentioned reading a script in my mind. Honestly, it is not a bad idea. I feel like it sort of makes me remember some common phrases and sentences and tricks my brain into thinking that I come up with these words myself. Of course, it is impossible to memorize everything. At some point, we will have to stop doing this, but for starting to get used to a language, I think this is a pretty useful technique.

No One Would Laugh At You :)
This is true. Hard to believe huh? Well, I used to also believe that I can't make any grammar mistakes in my speaking or else people would never understand what I'm talking about. This is false. According to some of my friends here in the US, even native speakers make grammar mistakes in their speaking. Also, if you've ever come to the US or know anything about American culture, you'll notice that they sometimes make up words or jokes that just don't really make any sense. So, why should we care about minor grammar mistakes in our speaking?

In the end, I just want to say thank you for reading till the end. This is sort of my first journal (at least on this website). Hope you learn something from it! I'm Wilson, and I'll see you next time.
